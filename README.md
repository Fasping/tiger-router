Tiger Router allows you to use Router, Route, and Link components in your projects.


## Installation

You can install Tiger Router using npm or yarn:

`npm install tiger-router`

`yarn add tiger-router`

## Getting Started

To use Tiger Router in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the Router component from the tiger-router package:

```js
import { Router } from 'tiger-router';
```

2. Wrap your application's components with the Router component, passing in the URL path and component to render as props:

```js
import { Router, Route } from 'tiger-router';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3. Use the Link component to navigate between routes:

```js
import { Link } from 'tiger-router';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}

export default Navbar;
```
